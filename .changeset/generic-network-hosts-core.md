Add `OfficialAdapterFactory` (+ `isOfficialAdapterFactory` guard) and the `NetworkHosts` type for generic, network-driven host resolution of discovery-adapter wallets.

An official ProviderAdapter (e.g. Walley) seals its `host` at construction (`private host`, no setter), so a pre-built instance cannot be re-pointed at another network's host. `OfficialAdapterFactory` is the `create(host)` form the generic bridge uses to construct the official adapter with a host resolved from registry data at connect time — so an app writes `<PartyLayerKit network="mainnet">` and never hardcodes a URL. `NetworkHosts` (`Partial<Record<NetworkId, string>>`) is the network→host mapping that lives as DATA in a wallet's registry entry. Both additive; the pre-constructed `OfficialProviderAdapter` instance form is unchanged.
